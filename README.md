# fract-ol
This project is about creating graphically beautiful fractals

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based
it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern
remains the same at every scale.

Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.
